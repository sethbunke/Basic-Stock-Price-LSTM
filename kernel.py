Timesteps = 60

60 time steps means that at each time 't' the RNN is going to look at the 60 stock prices.
Before time 't' that is the stock price is between 60 days before time 't' .
And based on the trends it is capturing during the 60 time steps will try to predict the next
output. So 60 time steps are the past information from which our RNN is going to try to learn and understand
some correlations or some trends.
